# MasterMind
Mastermind in Java

This game is a computer version of the board game Mastermind programmed in Java. It is a refreshing of my Java programming skills, 
nothing else. The game is not intendet for commercial use! For the graphics interface I used Swing, but only because I didn't think 
about other GUI Frameworks like JavaFX for example. Next time I will use JavaFX. ;-)
