# MasterMind
Mastermind in Java

This game is a computer version of the board game Mastermind programmed in Java. It was a refreshing of my Java programming skills, 
nothing else. The game is not intended for commercial use only for demonstration! 

I did the graphical positioning by Hand, just to train my brain a bit.

If there are some graphic issues, I had this in Ubuntu, it is necessary to use the hardware vendors driver of the graphic card installed 
in your system.
